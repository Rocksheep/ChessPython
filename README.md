# ChessPython
I started writing this code to learn more about Test Driven Development.
So it's mostly a learning project.

Tips for improvements are always welcome!

To run the unittests you can use the following command:
```
python3 -m unittest discover tests/unit/ "*_test.py"
```

Running the script will result in the board being printed to the terminal:

```
  abcdefgh
8 ♜♞♝♛♚♝♞♜
7 █ █ █ █ 
6  █ █ █ █
5 █ █ █ █ 
4  █ █ █ █
3 █ █ █ █ 
2  █ █ █ █
1 ♖♘♗♕♔♗♘♖
```

# Requirements
